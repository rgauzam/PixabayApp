**Future Improvements**
Given more time, I would prioritize the following enhancements to this project:

- Comprehensive Testing Suite:

Implement a robust set of unit and integration tests to ensure the reliability and maintainability of the codebase. This would include:
Thoroughly testing the ViewModel logic to ensure correct state transitions.
Mocking dependencies to isolate unit tests and validate business logic independently.
Writing UI tests to verify the correct rendering of UI components based on different UI states.
